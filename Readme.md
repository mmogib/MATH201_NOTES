# MATH201: Calculus III (Term 251)

This repository contains notes, exercises, and resources for **MATH201 – Calculus III**, offered by the Department of Mathematics at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM).

## 📚 Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to multivariable calculus, covering:

- Polar and parametric curves
- Vectors, lines, planes, and surfaces in space
- Cylindrical and spherical coordinates
- Functions of several variables, limits, and continuity
- Partial and directional derivatives, gradients, and tangent planes
- Extrema of multivariable functions with and without constraints
- Double and triple integrals in various coordinate systems

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Describe and analyze parametric and polar curves, and identify surfaces in space.
2. Compute areas, arc lengths, and surface areas in plane curves.
3. Perform vector operations and determine equations of lines and planes in 3D.
4. Analyze limits and continuity of multivariable functions.
5. Compute directional derivatives, gradients, and tangent planes.
6. Find local/global extrema of multivariable functions, including with Lagrange multipliers.
7. Evaluate multiple integrals in rectangular, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.

### ✅ Tips for Success

* Practice suggested problems, not just assigned ones.
* Review lecture material before each class.
* Work out solutions by hand before asking for help.
* Visit your instructor during office hours with prepared questions.
* Solve problems from chapter reviews and true/false sections.
